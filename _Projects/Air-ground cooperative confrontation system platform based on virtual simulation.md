## Background

<!-- 无人集群具备通过个体间的有效协作涌现出高于个体的群体智能，完成复杂环境下作战任务的能力，是军事装备体系智能化的驱动引擎，也将颠覆未来的作战形态。如何基于群体智能技术进行分布式协同感知及识别、协同认知与决策、协同制导与控制，是提高无人集群分布式协同作战效能的关键所在，也是新一代人工智能的核心研究领域。 -->

The unmanned swarm has the ability to emerge from the effective collaboration of individuals to achieve higher than individuals' swarm intelligence, and to complete combat tasks in complex environments. It is the driving engine for the intelligence of the military equipment system and will also subvert the future combat form. How to perform distributed collaborative perception and recognition, collaborative cognition and decision-making, and collaborative guidance and control based on swarm intelligence technology is the key to improving the effectiveness of distributed collaborative operations in unmanned clusters, and it is also the core research field of a new generation of artificial intelligence.

## Project content

<!-- 开发基于虚拟的异构无人集群攻防对抗仿真平台。攻防双方在生成的地图上拥有各自的阵地，参赛队开发群体智能协同算法，采用一定数量的无人机和无人车相互配合，协同搜索、识别和摧毁对方阵地内的静止和移动目标，同时协同拦截对方的无人机和无人车，保护己方的指挥所不被摧毁。其中，无人机具备协同探测和多机协同摧毁对方无人机的能力；无人车具协同探测和摧毁地面目标的能力；两者之间可以互相通信和协同。 -->

Develop a virtual heterogeneous unmanned cluster attack and defense countermeasure simulation platform. The offensive and defensive sides have their own positions on the generated map. The participating teams develop a group intelligent collaborative algorithm, and use a certain number of drones and unmanned vehicles to cooperate with each other to collaboratively search, identify and destroy stationary and moving targets in the opponent's position. Coordinately intercept the opponent's drones and unmanned vehicles to protect your command post from being destroyed. Among them, UAVs have the ability to coordinate detection and multi-aircraft to destroy each other's UAVs; unmanned vehicles have the ability to coordinate detection and destruction of ground targets; the two can communicate and cooperate with each other.

## My work

1. Design of UAV/UGV air-ground cooperative countermeasure demonstration algorithms.
2. Construction of a virtual coordinated combat scenario based on Gazebo simulator.
3. Development and redaction of Matlab/Python control API demos.

## Achievements

This competition requires each team to design and manufacture an aircraft which should satisfy the following requirements:

1. Driven by an internal combustion engine

2.  Remotely controlled to take off from a specific area

3.  Carry an amount of water as load

4. Can release the load after flying to a certain height (18m) above the release area.
