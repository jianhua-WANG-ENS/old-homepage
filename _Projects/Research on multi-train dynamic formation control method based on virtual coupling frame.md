## Our plan

<img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/04/e6qzKx.png" alt="e6qzKx.png" border="0"/>

The target temperature can be set using **an Android cellphone** or using **buttons**. There are three buttons on the top of our tank: 'SET', 'UP' and 'DOWN'. To set the temperature, press the 'SET' button, and the digital tube will flicker and display the target temperature. Continue to press the 'SET' key to select the digit, and adjust values through the 'UP' and 'DOWN' keys. After selecting the temperature and stopping operation for three seconds, the digital tube will display the current temperature and the device will warm up or cool down to the target temperature. 

Internal size: `300*200*150mm`

Accuracy: `< ±2℃` (Depending on the environment and how much water is loaded)

Adjustment time: `Approximately 5min` (Depending on the environment and how much water is loaded)

Simulation: `Multism`

PCB design: `Altium designer`

MCU program: `STM32CubeMX`, `Keil 5`    👉See the program [here](https://github.com/Li-Jinjie/Design-of-Settable-Constant-Temperature-Controller/tree/master).

### Implementation

1. **MCU & PID control system**

   |         Function          |  Name   | Number |
   | :-----------------------: | :-----: | :----: |
   |      Display circuit      |   IO    |   7    |
   |      Button circuit       |   IO    |   3    |
   |  Temperature measurement  |   ADC   |   2    |
   |          DS18B20          |   IO    |   1    |
   | PWM wave generate circuit |   IO    |   4    |
   |        PID circuit        | DAC/ADC |  2/1   |

   According to our design requirements, we chose STM32ZET6 core board as our MCU.

   In this course, the proportion of analog circuits is a scoring factor, so we used an analog PID circuit for temperature control, as the following pictures shows.

   | <img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/04/e6LERA.png" alt="e6LERA.png" border="0" /> |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | <img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/04/e6LWdO.png" alt="e6LWdO.png" border="0" /> |

   Initially, we did not design a **limiting circuit** for the integral circuits, which had terrible consequences in practical application. The maximum voltage of OP07 is ±10V. So if not design a limiter, the voltage of the integrated circuit will increase to 10V at the beginning of heating, which is much larger than the ADC range (0-3.3V). 

   The PID value can be changed by adjusting the potentiometers.

2. **Temperature measurement circuit**

   Pt resistance (Pt 100) was selected to measure the temperature. Pt 100 can convert
   the temperature signal into an analog voltage signal. And then through A/D
   conversion, the analog signal can be converted into a digital signal which can be processed by the MCU.

   <img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/04/e6LfoD.png" alt="e6LfoD.png" border="0" />

   We used a DS18B20 component as standard to calibrate Pt resistance. The calibration curve is as follows:

   <img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/04/e6LbOP.png" alt="e6LbOP.png" border="0" height="350" style="float:middle"/>

   Therefore, `T = 72.643×U-19.723`

3. **Display and buttons circuits**

   Choose 74LS139D as a decoder, and four seven-segment digital tubes to show the temperature `XXX.X`. 

   | Display                                                      | Buttons                                                      |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | <img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/04/e6LXTS.png" alt="e6LXTS.png" border="0" /> | <img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/04/e6LVxI.png" alt="e6LVxI.png" border="0" /> |

4. **Power circuit**

   The power supply needs to convert 220V 50Hz AC power into ±12V to supply operation amplifiers, into + 12V to the cooling module, and + 5V to the control circuit.

   <img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/08/04/e6LvFg.png" alt="e6LvFg.png" border="0" />

5. **Bluetooth and APP**

   We selected the HC-08 module, which adopts the serial communication protocol and BLE4.0 to support Android and iOS system.

   We used Android Studio to develop an Android App. We used the built-in Bluetooth API to connect the App with the HC-08 module. We completed the function of displaying and controlling the temperature on the cellphone.

6. **Healing module**

   We used a 220V, 600W heating plate to heat the tank. The heating plate was pasted at the bottom to increase the contact area between the heater and the system and make the heating more uniform. After testing, the heating efficiency was 2 ℃/min.

   PID control method needs to adjust the power of the heating plate. We connected the relay to the heating circuit and controlled the relay's switching-on and off by generating PWM wave (5V) through the 555 timer circuit. By changing the duty cycle of the PWM wave, the power of the heating plate can be changed.

7. **Cooling module**

   To cool water quickly, we designed a refrigeration module to speed up the heat dissipation of the system. At first, we used 12V 140W 1275 semiconductor chiller. After testing, we found the cooling effect to be ineffective. Later, we used two fans instead to accelerate the heat dissipation, which significantly accelerated the cooling speed.

8. **PCB boards**

   We drew two 10cm*10cm PCB boards to actuate the whole circuits and connect the two boards with an MCU board. The PCB boards are as follows and you can download them from [here](https://github.com/Li-Jinjie/Design-of-Settable-Constant-Temperature-Controller/tree/master/PCB%20Board).
