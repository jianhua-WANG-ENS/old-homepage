## Background

<!-- 无人集群具备通过个体间的有效协作涌现出高于个体的群体智能，完成复杂环境下作战任务的能力，是军事装备体系智能化的驱动引擎，也将颠覆未来的作战形态。如何基于群体智能技术进行分布式协同感知及识别、协同认知与决策、协同制导与控制，是提高无人集群分布式协同作战效能的关键所在，也是新一代人工智能的核心研究领域。 -->

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
Distributed cooperative control for multi-agent systems (MASs) has attracted extensive research attention from both control and
robotics communities during the last decade. This is because of its broad range of applications in areas, such as service robots, exploration of hazardous environments, military surveillance, and spacecraft formation flying. In contrast to deploying individual agents to fulfill various tasks, coordinating a group of autonomous agents to accomplish a common goal offers several benefits, such as scalability, flexibility, adaptivity, and low cost of operation.

## Project content

<!-- 开发基于虚拟的异构无人集群攻防对抗仿真平台。攻防双方在生成的地图上拥有各自的阵地，参赛队开发群体智能协同算法，采用一定数量的无人机和无人车相互配合，协同搜索、识别和摧毁对方阵地内的静止和移动目标，同时协同拦截对方的无人机和无人车，保护己方的指挥所不被摧毁。其中，无人机具备协同探测和多机协同摧毁对方无人机的能力；无人车具协同探测和摧毁地面目标的能力；两者之间可以互相通信和协同。 -->

<!-- multi-UAV/UGV swarm attack and defense platform -->

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
Multi-UAV and multi-UGV systems are typical air and ground multi-agent systems. The objective of this project is to develop a multi-UAV/UGV swarm attack and defense platform. The offensive and defensive sides have their own positions on the generated map. Each team will design intelligent cooperative swarm algorithms to control their UAVs and UGVs. More specifically, the players will employ a certain number of UAVs and UGVs to search, identify and destroy opponent's targets. At the same time, they need to intercept the opponent's UAVs and UGVs to protect their command post. The Matlab/Python control interface will be designed and opened to players to control the UAVs and UGVs.

## My work

1. Design of UAV/UGV air-ground cooperative countermeasure demonstration algorithms.
2. Construction of a virtual coordinated combat scenario based on Gazebo simulator.
3. Development and redaction of Matlab/Python control API demos.
