## Background

<!-- 无人机是现代化战争中重要的作战装备之一。作为可靠的空中打击力量，高效的无人机作战往往可以决胜于千里之外。无人机集群具有自主化与智能化特点，在灵活性与可靠性等方面具有显著优势。在协同侦查打击任务中，多无人机可以充分发挥集群优势，对目标进行大范围搜索探测；当发现目标后，多无人机对目标进行多角度观测，并将多源感知信息进行融合处理；决策系统根据感知融合结果进行在线任务规划，制定出合理可行的飞行方案；多无人机以特定的编队构型保持对目标轨迹的跟踪，最后在恰当的时机对目标进行集群打击。 -->

Formation tracking control for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems has received considerable interests in recent years due to its broad potential applications in civilian and military areas, such as drag reduction, radiation detection, target search localization, and telecommunication relay. In the past decades, many formation control approaches have been proposed in the robotics community, such as leader–follower, behavior, and virtual structure-based approaches. With the development of UAV technology and the increasing demand of formation tracking control for multi-UAV systems, more and more researchers investigate the formation tracking problems for multi-UAV systems with different constraints.

This project focuses on the formation tracking control problem for multi-UAV systems with maneuvering targets, and conducts in-depth research on adaptive formation tracking control methods. More specifically, the constraints like unknown target maneuvering acceleration, unknown global topology information, and limited target state observation are taken into account. The related formation tracking protocols are designed and the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed. Finally, the feasibility of the designed formation tracking protocols is verified by virtual simulations and real multiple UAVs experiments.
